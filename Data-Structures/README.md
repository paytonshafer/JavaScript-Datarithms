# Data Structures in Java Script

This folder contains a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in JavaScript. Each data structure is designed to provide efficient solutions for various algorithmic problems and can be used as building blocks for more complex applications.

## 1. Dynamic Array

A dynamic array implementation that allows you to efficiently add, remove, and access elements with automatic resizing.

## 2. Linked List

A classic linked list implementation with support for insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

## 3. Circular Dequeue

A circular dequeue (double-ended queue) that supports insertion and deletion from both the front and back.

## 4. Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

## 5. Hash Table

A hash table implementation for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.

## 6. Heap

A binary heap implementation, supporting both min-heap and max-heap operations.

## 7. Graph

A graph representation with basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) and other fundamental graph operations.

## 8. Segment Tree

A segment tree implementation for efficient range query operations on an array.
