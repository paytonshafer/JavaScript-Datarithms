## Dynamic Array

A dynamic array implementation that allows you to efficiently add, remove, and access elements with automatic resizing.

## Linked List

A classic linked list implementation with support for insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

## Circular Dequeue

A circular dequeue (double-ended queue) that supports insertion and deletion from both the front and back.

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

## Hash Table

A hash table implementation for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.

## Graph

A graph representation with basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
